# Tips Data Analysis

Small data-analysis project containing the classic "tips" dataset and an exploratory Jupyter notebook.

## Project overview

This repository provides a CSV copy of the `tips` dataset plus an interactive notebook that demonstrates common data analysis and visualization tasks (summary statistics, grouping/aggregation, and plots).

It's ideal as a learning sandbox for pandas/seaborn or as a starting point for a short exploratory analysis assignment.

## Files in this repository

- `tips.csv` — Comma-separated dataset (one table) containing restaurant tips data.
- `tips.ipynb` — A Jupyter notebook with data loading, exploratory analysis, and example visualizations.
- `README.md` — This file (project description and quickstart).

## Quickstart (run locally)

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended)
- pip
- A Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Notebook) or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

Recommended Python packages:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the minimum dependencies in your environment (PowerShell example):

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib jupyterlab
```

Start Jupyter Lab and open the notebook:

```powershell
jupyter lab
# then open `tips.ipynb` in your browser
```

Or open `tips.ipynb` directly in VS Code (Install the Jupyter extension if needed).

## Minimal quick checks (Python)

If you just want to run a quick check from a Python REPL or a script to ensure the CSV loads correctly:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('tips.csv')
print(tips.shape)
print(tips.dtypes)
print(tips.head())
```

## Notes & next steps

- The notebook contains example charts using seaborn (e.g., boxplots, scatterplots, countplots). Feel free to extend it with custom aggregation, hypothesis tests, or predictive models.
- If you plan to share or publish work, consider adding a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for reproducible environments.
